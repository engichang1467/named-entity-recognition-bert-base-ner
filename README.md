# Named Entity Recognition with BERT-base-NER

Welcome to the Named Entity Recognition with BERT-base-NER project! This project leverages the power of the [`dslim/bert-base-NER`](https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER) model to generate summaries from any text input.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

To get started, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

Now, you can run the application:

```bash
gradio app.py
```

This will start the application, allowing you to input text and receive a summary generated by the DistilBART-CNN model.

## Usage

Simply input the text you want to summarize into the application's interface. The model will then process the input and provide a concise summary of the text.
